# UX

## Mobile-First

We live in a world where the majority of users are on mobile devices.
Consequently, Firestorm is designed in [a mobile-first
fashion](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/a-hands-on-guide-to-mobile-first-design/).

TODO: We could use some great links in this section for introductions and
details on mobile-first design, for anyone that's not familiar with the idea.

## Progressive Enhancement

There are two strategies around supporting mobile and desktop in the same
codebase. One is "Progressive Enhancement" and the other is "Graceful
Degradation." If you're doing Mobile First, you are by necessity doing
Progressive Enhancement, so that's our strategy. I felt it was worth calling it
out specifically.

## Style Guide

We will have an official style guide linked here, eventually. In general, we're
going to use the [Material Design](https://material.io/) language.
