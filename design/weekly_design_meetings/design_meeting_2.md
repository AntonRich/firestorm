TODO: Links to video and meeting notes, once this meeting occurs.

## Agenda

This is the second weekly design meeting for the Firestorm Phoenix-based Forum
Engine (https://github.com/dailydrip/firestorm).  We intend to discuss the
following:

- Review Logo Options [5 minutes]
  - Amy will have some logo options for us to review
  - What do we like?
  - What should we change?
  - None worth pursuing? One obviously amazing?
- Review Initial UI Ideas [15 minutes]
  - She'll also have some basic designs for the first three screens, hopefully:
    - Mobile-first homepage, which just lists all the topics
    - Mobile-first topic page, which lists all the posts
    - Mobile-first editing view
  - Let's focus specifically on the data that should be present on each of these
    views and what prominence they should receive
- Discuss Initial Data Model [10 minutes]
  - What have we missed?
  - What is extraneous?
- Discuss OTP / Phoenix / API Design [15 minutes]
  - How should the OTP app for a forum behave, ignoring any UI/Web concerns? I
    hope to have some first-thoughts ready for this
- CONTRIBUTING [5 minutes]
  - How can you help?
  - I should have a CONTRIBUTING.md in place by now - let's talk through it,
    what it means, and what it lacks.
- Open discussion [10 minutes]
  - [META] How can we run this meeting better next time?
  - What should next week's agenda cover?
    - Idea: search
  - Any general purpose questions?
