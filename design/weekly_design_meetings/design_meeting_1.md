## Agenda

This is the first weekly design meeting for the Firestorm Phoenix-based Forum
Engine.  We intend to discuss the following:

- Initial Graphic Design thoughts
  - We should identify features we like from existing forums (discourse, google
    groups, etc.) and enumerate them with pros and cons
  - We will discuss logo, branding, colors
- Initial Data Model thoughts
  - We will identify the initial data model, begin a diagram (maybe), and
    discuss pros and cons of various options.
