# Contribution Guidelines

This file outlines how you can best contribute to this project. Firestorm is
presently in the design phase. We don't intend to write the actual code until
we've finished fleshing everything out in our Weekly Design Meetings. However,
there are a number of ways that you can contribute presently.

## Data Model

You can see [the current state of the Data Model](./design/DATA_MODEL.md). We
are presently working out this in terms of structs. Contributions in this area
are greatly appreciated - just send a PR that modifies that file.

## UX Mockups

You can see [the current state of the UX](./design/UX.md). We are working
through this in the design meetings, but if you have anything you'd like to
contribute there, send a PR.

## Forum OTP Application

Here you can see [the current state of the OTP Application
design](./design/OTP.md).

We will be building Firestorm primarily as an OTP application that has a Phoenix
web interface to it, because [Phoenix is an Interface, Not Your
Application](https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/elixir/drips/phoenix-is-not-your-application)
([part 2](https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/elixir/drips/phoenix-is-an-interface-not-your-application-part-2)).
